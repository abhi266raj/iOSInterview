1. There is a class Car. There is another class CarFactory. We want that init of class car to be accessed by no other class except CarFactory. Code this.  
2. There is a singleton class NetworkManager. But people are misusing it by not calling sharedInstance but calling init directly. How will you solve this problem. 
3. You are creating Networking library like Alomafire. There is a class NetworkManager. You want it used by others but should not be subclassed. How will you do this.
